# Challenge 1: Initial Project Setup (Paving the Way)
In this challenge, we will create a modular JavaScript installation with a simple smoke test, and a simple entry point.

## Learning Objectives
* Initialize a JS project structure.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to:
* Set up an entry point that logs "Hello Transformer!" to the console.
* Set up testing with a simple smoke test.
