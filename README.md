# A Transformer, written in JavaScript

This is an implementation of the [Transformer
architecture](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) from [Attention is all
you
need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)
in pure JavaScript, with no external libraries.

## Why

Because no-one's done it and because I want to properly understand the concepts
behind what makes a Transformer work. Building it from scratch is the best way I
know how to do that.

## Getting Started

I'll update this when I have something to get started with.
